# üöÄ Topic : Internet Basics

**Welcome to your web development journey!** Start here if you're new to computers and programming.

## ‚úÖ Your Learning Checklist

### Week 1: Computer and Internet Basics
- [ ] **1**: File systems, folders, operating system navigation
  
  **üéØ Learning Objectives:** By the end of today, you'll understand how your computer organizes files and how to navigate using both visual and command-line interfaces.
  
  **üìñ Theory (20 minutes):**
  
  **What is a File System?**
  - Your computer organizes all files and folders in a tree-like structure
  - Every file has a specific location called a "path"
  - Think of it like a mailing address for your files
  
  **File Paths Explained:**
  - **Absolute Path**: Complete address from the root (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Documents/project.txt`)
  - **Relative Path**: Address relative to current location (e.g., `./Documents/project.txt`)
  - **Root directory**: The top-level folder (Windows: `C:\`, Mac/Linux: `/`)
  
  **Common File Extensions:**
  - `.txt` - Text files
  - `.html` - Web pages
  - `.css` - Stylesheets
  - `.js` - JavaScript code
  - `.png/.jpg` - Images
  - `.pdf` - Documents
  
  **Command Line Basics**
  
  **Windows (Command Prompt):**
  # Open Command Prompt (Win+R, type cmd, Enter)

  ```cmd
  dir                    # List files in current directory
  cd Documents           # Change to Documents folder
  cd ..                  # Go up one level
  mkdir WebDev-Practice  # Create a new folder
  cd WebDev-Practice     # Enter the folder
  echo. > hello.txt      # Create an empty file
  dir                    # See your new file
  ```
  
  **Mac/Linux (Terminal):**
  # Open Terminal (Cmd+Space, type "terminal", Enter)

  ```bash
  ls                     # List files in current directory
  cd Documents           # Change to Documents folder
  cd ..                  # Go up one level
  mkdir WebDev-Practice  # Create a new folder
  cd WebDev-Practice     # Enter the folder
  touch hello.txt        # Create an empty file
  ls                     # See your new file
  pwd                    # See current path (print working directory)
  ```
  
  **üí° Key Takeaways:**
  - [x] I understand the difference between absolute and relative paths
  - [x] I can navigate using command line/terminal
  - [x] I know common file extensions and their purposes
  - [x] I can create folders and files using command line
  - [x] I understand the concept of "current directory"
  - [x] I know how to see where I am in the file system (`pwd` or current path)

- [ ] **2**: Client-server model, HTTP, URLs, domains, hosting
  
  **üéØ Learning Objectives:** Understand how the internet works, what happens when you visit a website, and the basic architecture of web communication.
  
  **üìñ Theory (25 minutes):**
  
  **The Client-Server Model:**
  - **Client**: Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) that requests information
  - **Server**: A computer that stores websites and sends them back to you
  - **Communication**: They talk to each other using protocols (rules)
  
  **What Happens When You Type google.com:**
  1. **DNS Lookup**: Your browser asks "What's the address of google.com?"
  2. **Server Request**: Browser sends a request to Google's servers
  3. **Server Response**: Google's server sends back the website code
  4. **Browser Renders**: Your browser displays the website
  
  **Understanding URLs (Uniform Resource Locators):**
  ```
  https://www.example.com:443/path/to/page?param=value#section
  ^^^^    ^^^  ^^^^^^^  ^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^
   |       |      |     |        |            |           |
  Protocol Sub   Domain Port    Path       Parameters   Fragment
  ```
  
  **Common Protocols:**
  - `http://` - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (not secure)
  - `https://` - HTTP Secure (encrypted, safe)
  - `ftp://` - File Transfer Protocol
  
  **Domain Name System (DNS):**
  - Converts human-readable names (google.com) to IP addresses (172.217.14.206)
  - Like a phone book for the internet
  - Managed by domain registrars (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
  
  **Web Hosting Types:**
  - **Shared**: Multiple websites share one server (cheap, basic)
  - **VPS**: Virtual Private Server (more control, medium cost)
  - **Dedicated**: Entire server for your website (expensive, full control)
  - **Cloud**: Multiple servers working together (scalable)
  
  **üõ†Ô∏è Practical Exercises (35 minutes):**
  
  **Exercise 1: URL Dissection**
  1. Visit: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
  2. Break down this URL and identify:
     - Protocol: `https://`
     - Domain: `www.youtube.com`
     - Path: `/watch`
     - Parameters: `?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
  3. Try removing `www.` - does it still work?
  
  **Exercise 2: DNS Investigation**
  
  **Windows:**
  ```cmd
  # Open Command Prompt
  nslookup google.com    # Find Google's IP address
  ping google.com        # Test connection to Google
  tracert google.com     # See the route to Google
  ```
  
  **Mac/Linux:**
  ```bash
  # Open Terminal
  nslookup google.com    # Find Google's IP address
  ping google.com        # Test connection to Google (Ctrl+C to stop)
  traceroute google.com  # See the route to Google
  ```

  - Essential for collaboration with other developers
  - Backup system for your code
  
  **Why Do We Need It?**
  - **Safety**: Never lose your work
  - **History**: See what changed and when
  - **Collaboration**: Multiple people working on same project
  - **Experimentation**: Try new features without breaking existing code
  - **Blame/Credit**: See who made what changes
  
  **Git vs GitHub (Common Confusion):**
  - **Git**: The version control system (software on your computer)
  - **GitHub**: Online service to store Git repositories (like Google Drive for code)
  - Other alternatives: GitLab, Bitbucket

  **üìñ Theory (20 minutes):**
  
  **What are Packages/Libraries?**
  - **Package**: Pre-written code that solves common problems
  - **Library**: Collection of functions you can use in your code
  - **Framework**: More structured, tells you how to organize your code
  - Instead of writing everything from scratch, use existing solutions
  
  **Why Use Packages?**
  - **Save Time**: Don't reinvent the wheel
  - **Quality**: Tested by thousands of developers
  - **Security**: Maintained and updated regularly
  - **Standards**: Industry-proven solutions
  
  **Package Managers by Language:**

  - **Python**: pip (Pip Installs Packages)
  - **Ruby**: gem
  - **PHP**: Composer
  - **Java**: Maven, Gradle
  
  **Dependency Concepts:**
  - **Dependency**: A package your project needs
  - **Transitive Dependencies**: Dependencies of your dependencies
  - **Version**: Different releases of the same package
  - **Semantic Versioning**: Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 2.1.3)
  
  **üõ†Ô∏è Practical Exercises (40 minutes):**

    "dependencies": {
      "lodash": "^4.17.21"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "prettier": "^2.8.0"
    }
  }
  ```
  
  **Exercise 3: Python pip Exploration**
  If you have Python installed:
  ```bash
  # Check if pip is installed
  pip --version
  
  # Search for packages
  pip search requests
  
  # See installed packages
  pip list
  ```
  
  **Exercise 4: Understanding Semantic Versioning**
  Practice reading version numbers:
  - `1.2.3` = Major.Minor.Patch
  - `^1.2.3` = Compatible with 1.2.3, up to 2.0.0
  - `~1.2.3` = Compatible with 1.2.3, up to 1.3.0
  - `1.2.3` = Exactly 1.2.3
